# FastAPI

## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Itâ€™s designed to be easy to use and to help you build robust APIs quickly.

In this project, I created a script called `macapp.py` that demonstrates how to build a simple FastAPI application.

## How to Create and Test a FastAPI API Locally

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Before you start, you need to install the necessary Python packages: `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.

Run the following command to install these packages:

```bash

pip install fastapi uvicorn

Step 2: Verify Installation

To confirm that the packages were installed correctly, you can run the following commands:

pip show fastapi

pip show uvicorn

Or you can check the installed packages list filtered by name:

pip list | grep fastapi

pip list | grep uvicorn

## Running Your FastAPI Application:

Once you have macapp.py ready, you can run your FastAPI app locally with uvicorn:

uvicorn macapp:app --reload

Here, macapp is the filename (without .py), and app is the FastAPI instance inside that file.

The --reload flag enables auto-reload on code changes, which is useful during development.

## Next Steps:
